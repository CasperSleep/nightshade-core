 Galleries commonly hold collection of images or text that the user cycles
 through.  Galleries can have thumbnails or dots for pagination as well as
 next and previous arrows.

 Casper Galleries come in various degrees of firmness depending
 on the content.

  **NB** We are phasing out background galleries in favor of the retina
   flavor. Pardon the unrest, but our galleries are snoozing in
   Nightshade at the moment. Check out Casper.com to see them in action.


  ### Background Images

  These galleries inline images as CSS backgrounds.

  ### Retina Enhanced

  These galleries leverage the `<picture>` element to serve retina
  and non-retina images.

   To instantiate a carousel include the partial and pass in the necessary
   parameters.
