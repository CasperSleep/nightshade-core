# Nightshade Core

_**N.B.** This repo is very specific to Casper. We've released it for others
to share our approach, but we don't recommend using it in your production
environment for the time being.`_

## Working with Nightshade Styles

Install the repo with npm. The following will install the latest in `master`.

```bash
npm install CasperSleep/nightshade-core -D
```

We **highly recommend** installing a tag of the repo `#v1.1.0`.

Include stylesheets in your application. To get all of our tooling and plugins,

```sass
// Third part dependencies
@import './node_modules/accoutrement-color/sass/color;
@import './node_modules/susy;
```
